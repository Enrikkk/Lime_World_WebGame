## 🚀 **Project Planning**

The development of *The Avenged Legend* follows a simple 3-phase plan:

### 🧩 **Sprint 1 — Plan**

Kick things off by setting up the foundation — defining the concept, architecture, and basic file structure.
We’ll outline core modules, domain classes, and prepare documentation for the next sprint.

---

### ⚙️ **Sprint 2 — MVP**

This is where the world comes alive.
The focus here is on building the **core gameplay** loop — player movement, combat, and basic interactions.
The main character will be able to explore the map, fight enemies, and trigger basic quests.
The MVP will also include the initial art pass, including the map, main character, and enemy designs.

---

### ✨ **Sprint 3 — Full + Polish**

Now we expand and refine everything.
We’ll add **NPCs**, **missions**, and **shops**, plus more complex combat features like **secondary attacks**, **powerups**, and **status effects** (like bleeding).
Inventory management will be modeled with **LocalStorage + JSONBin**, allowing saved progress across devices.
The final boss will get **summons**, a **second phase**, and custom art.
Finally, we’ll polish UI, add extra enemies, and wrap it all up with documentation, pitch materials, and a playable demo.
