## ✨ What's New? (Differences from MVP)

We have unlocked the world boundaries. While the MVP was limited to the tutorial and village, the Full Version opens the gates to the wilderness:

### ⚔️ Two Massive New Zones
1.  **The West Woods (Left Zone):**
    * A dangerous area overrun by standard Lime Monsters.
    * **Strategy:** This is the ideal place to farm **Lime Coins**. Build up your economy here so you always have the funds to respawn.

2.  **The Badlands (Right Zone):**
    * A high-level area featuring tougher aggression and stronger enemies.
    * **The Reward:** Only the brave should venture here. This is the primary source for the rarest **Lime-Blobs** needed to complete the game.

### 📦 Complete Feature Set
* **Full Map Access:** Freely travel between the Tutorial, Village (NPCs), Left, and Right zones without invisible walls blocking your path.
* **End-Game Objective:** Collect enough curative Lime-Blobs to fulfill the game's ultimate purpose.
* **High-Stakes Combat:** With more enemies comes a higher risk of death. Remember: if you run out of coins, your save data is wiped.
